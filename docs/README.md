## Overview ðŸ¤– ðŸ“– {docsify-ignore}

The purpose of SvelteML is to offer simple Components that can make ML more accessible. It leverages TensorflowJS to offer Svelte apps ML features out-of-the-box. It relies heavily on Svelte's reactivity feature and event hooks can be used to extend out the ML flow. e.g. on:poses in the Pose Estimator will give you the raw poses directfrom TensorflowJS.

## Quick Start

    npm install svelteml --save

## Overview

> All Components try to be reactive so although it feels very declarative, it is also reacting to your input.
> Add an issue in Github if you need a specific behaviour or if there is a bug or would like to recommend something. You know the drill.
